##
# This command will go through your repository's working directory, and if it
# discovers any files that it was tracking, but have mysteriously disappeared,
# the command will assume you meant to remove it (stop tracking it), and remove it
# for you. Similarly, if you have any files that are untracked and have appeared
# in your repository, and they aren't ignored by your .hgignore file, then we
# assume you wanted to add them, and add them for you.
#
# The only significant difference between this command and Mercurial's implementation
# is the addition of the interactive mode. This mode asks the user before each removal
# and addition. Personally, I added it because I don't like blanket actions taken across
# my entire repository. It's off by default.
