  # = Hook
  # The hook class allows the end-user to easily provide hooks into the code that
  # makes Amp go. For example, one might want to easily hook into the commit command,
  # and send an e-mail out to your team after every commit. You could use the Hook class,
  # as well as the Kernel-level "hook" method, to do this.
  #
  # Hooks are global, currently - they cannot only be applied to one repo at a time.
