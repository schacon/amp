      # = AncestorGenerator
      # A generator class that will allow us to only calculate one ancestor
      # of a node at a time, so we don't have to process the full list of
      # ancestors for each node twice. Our old, lazy way was, if you have two
      # nodes A and B, and need to find the common ancestor, we would generate
      # *all* nodes in both A, and B's history. If the two have a very close
      # common ancestor (usually the case when doing a branch merge in a rapid
      # development environment), then this is a huge amount of wasted processing.
      # Generators aren't a familiar construct for most ruby developers, and they
      # work via continuations, which are also typically avoided like the plague.
      # Check out 'lib/support/generator.rb' to see how it works.
